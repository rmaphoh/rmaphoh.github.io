### Project Overview

We are recruiting **two motivated research fellows** with backgrounds in computer science, biomedical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, or related fields. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research in **multi-modal foundation models**, **agentic AI**, and their **translation to real-world clinical studies**.

The project is supported by the **Wellcome Early-Career Award** and aims to develop novel, impactful methodologies to enhance public healthcare through AI. Research themes include disease detection and prediction, subtype stratification, treatment outcome forecasting, and personalised clinical decision support.

### Role Descriptions

Each position focuses on a distinct but complementary area:

1. **Foundation Model Development & Data Strategy**
   - Investigate the impact of data quantity, diversity, and distribution on foundation model performance and generalisability.
   - Design efficient data sampling strategies and novel training protocols to optimise foundation model performance including generalisability and fairness.

2. **Foundation Model Evaluation & Agentic Integration**
   - Study and evaluate state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models.
   - Develop agentic AI workflows to develop generalisable, robust pipelines for downstream healthcare tasks.


### Requirement

- PhD in computer science, biomedical engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, or relevant fields.
- A strong track record in AI for healthcare research.
- Strong publication records in high-profile journals and conferences.
- Good knowledge in dealing with common challenges in medical data analysis, e.g. data missing, data noise, and data scarcity.
- Experience working in a multidisciplinary team and collaborating with both clinical and non-clinical researchers.
