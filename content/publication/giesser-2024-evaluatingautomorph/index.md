abstract: 'Purpose: Current research on artificial intelligence-based fundus photography
  biomarkers has demonstrated inconsistent results. Consequently, we aimed to evaluate
  and predict the test-retest reliability of retinal parameters extracted from fundus
  photography. Methods: Two groups of patients were recruited for the study: an intervisit
  group (n = 28) to assess retest reliability over a period of 1 to 14Â days and an
  intravisit group (n = 44) to evaluate retest reliability within a single session.
  Using AutoMorph, we generated test and retest vessel segmentation maps; measured
  segmentation map agreement via accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score and Jaccard index;
  and calculated 76 metrics from each fundus image. The retest reliability of each
  metric was analyzed in terms of the Spearman correlation coefficient, intraclass
  correlation coefficient (ICC), and relative percentage change. A linear model with
  the input variables contrast-to-noise-ratio and fractal dimension, chosen by a P-value-based
  backward selection process, was developed to predict the median percentage difference
  on retest per image based on image-quality metrics. This model was trained on the
  intravisit dataset and validated using the intervisit dataset. Results: In the intervisit
  group, retest reliability varied between Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.34
  and 0.99, ICC values of 0.31 to 0.99, and mean absolute percentage differences of
  0.96% to 223.67%. Similarly, in the intravisit group, the retest reliability ranged
  from Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.55 and 0.96, ICC values of 0.40 to 0.97,
  and mean percentage differences of 0.49% to 371.23%. Segmentation map accuracy between
  test and retest never dropped below 97%; the mean F1 scores were 0.85 for the intravisit
  dataset and 0.82 for the intervisit dataset. The best retest was achieved with disc-width
  regarding the Spearman correlation coefficient in both datasets. In terms of the
  Spearman correlation coefficient, the worst retests of the intervisit and intravisit
  groups were tortuosity density and artery tortuosity density, respectively. The
  intravisit group exhibited better retest reliability than the intervisit group (P
  < 0.001). Our linear model, with the two independent variables contrast-to-noise
  ratio and fractal dimension predicted the median retest reliability per image on
  its validation dataset, the intervisit group, with an R2 of 0.53 (P < 0.001). Conclusions:
  Our findings highlight a considerable volatility in the reliability of some retinal
  biomarkers. Improving retest could allow disease progression modeling in smaller
  datasets or an individualized treatment approach. Image quality is moderately predictive
  of retest reliability, and further work is warranted to understand the reasons behind
  our observations better and thus ensure consistent retest results.'
