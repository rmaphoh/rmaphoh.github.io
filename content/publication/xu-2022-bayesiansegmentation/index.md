abstract: This paper concerns pseudo labelling in segmentation. Our contribution is
  fourfold. Firstly, we present a new formulation of pseudo-labelling as an Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) algorithm for clear statistical interpretation. Secondly, we propose a semi-supervised
  medical image segmentation method purely based on the original pseudo labelling,
  namely SegPL. We demonstrate SegPL is a competitive approach against state-of-the-art
  consistency regularisation based methods on semi-supervised segmentation on a 2D
  multi-class MRI brain tumour segmentation task and a 3D binary CT lung vessel segmentation
  task. The simplicity of SegPL allows less computational cost comparing to prior
  methods. Thirdly, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of SegPL may originate from
  its robustness against out-of-distribution noises and adversarial attacks. Lastly,
  under the EM framework, we introduce a probabilistic generalisation of SegPL via
  variational inference, which learns a dynamic threshold for pseudo labelling during
  the training. We show that SegPL with variational inference can perform uncertainty
  estimation on par with the gold-standard method Deep Ensemble.
