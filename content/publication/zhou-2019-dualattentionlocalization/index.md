abstract: The research on recognizing the most discriminative regions provides referential
  information for weakly supervised object localization with only image-level annotations.
  However, the most discriminative regions usually conceal the other parts of the
  object, thereby impeding entire object recognition and localization. To tackle this
  problem, the Dual-attention Focused Module (DFM) is proposed to enhance object localization
  performance. Specifically, we present a dual attention module for information fusion,
  consisting of a position branch and a channel one. In each branch, the input feature
  map is deduced into an enhancement map and a mask map, thereby highlighting the
  most discriminative parts or hiding them. For the position mask map, we introduce
  a focused matrix to enhance it, which utilizes the principle that the pixels of
  an object are continuous. Between these two branches, the enhancement map is integrated
  with the mask map, aiming at partially compensating the lost information and diversifies
  the features. With the dual-attention module and focused matrix, the entire object
  region could be precisely recognized with implicit information. We demonstrate outperforming
  results of DFM in experiments. In particular, DFM achieves state-of-the-art performance
  in localization accuracy in ILSVRC 2016 and CUB-200-2011.
