abstract: 'In this paper, we study pseudo-labelling. Pseudo-labelling employs raw
  inferences on unlabelled data as pseudo-labels for self-training. We elucidate the
  empirical successes of pseudo-labelling by establishing a link between this technique
  and the Expectation Maximisation algorithm. Through this, we realise that the original
  pseudo-labelling serves as an empirical estimation of its more comprehensive underlying
  formulation. Following this insight, we present a full generalisation of pseudo-labels
  under Bayesâ€™ theorem, termed Bayesian Pseudo Labels. Subsequently, we introduce
  a variational approach to generate these Bayesian Pseudo Labels, involving the learning
  of a threshold to automatically select high-quality pseudo labels. In the remainder
  of the paper, we showcase the applications of pseudo-labelling and its generalised
  form, Bayesian Pseudo-Labelling, in the semi-supervised segmentation of medical
  images. Specifically, we focus on: (1) 3D binary segmentation of lung vessels from
  CT volumes; (2) 2D multi-class segmentation of brain tumours from MRI volumes; (3)
  3D binary segmentation of whole brain tumours from MRI volumes; and (4) 3D binary
  segmentation of prostate from MRI volumes. We further demonstrate that pseudo-labels
  can enhance the robustness of the learned representations. The code is released
  in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/moucheng2017/EMSSL.'
