abstract: 'Purpose: To compare automated and semiautomated methods for the measurement
  of retinal microvascular biomarkers: the automated retinal vascular morphology (AutoMorph)
  algorithm and the Singapore “I” Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. Methods: Analysis
  of retinal fundus photographs centered on optic discs from the population-based
  Montrachet Study of adults aged 75 years and older. Comparison and agreement evaluation
  with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between SIVA and AutoMorph measures
  of the central retinal venular and arteriolar equivalent, arteriolar–venular ratio,
  and fractal dimension. Results: Overall, 1069 fundus photographs were included in
  this study. The mean age of the patients was 80.04 ± 3.94 years. After the image
  quality grading process with an optimal threshold, the lowest rejection rate was
  51.17% for the AutoMorph analysis (n = 522). The measure of agreement between SIVA
  and AutoMorph retinal microvascular biomarkers showed a good correlation for vascular
  complexity (ICC, 0.77–0.47), a poor correlation for vascular calibers (ICC, 0.36–0.23),
  and no correlation for vascular tortuosity. Significant associations between retinal
  biomarkers and systemic variables (age, history of stroke, and systolic blood pressure)
  were consistent between SIVA and AutoMorph. Conclusions: In this dataset, AutoMorph
  presented a substantial rejection rate. SIVA and AutoMorph provided well-correlated
  measurements of vascular complexity and caliber with consistent clinical associations.
  Further comparisons are needed before a transition is made from semiautomated to
  automated algorithms for the analysis of retinal microvascular biomarkers. Translational
  Relevance: Open source software needs to be compared with former semiautomated software
  for retinal microvascular biomarkers assessment before transition in daily clinic
  and collaborative research.'
