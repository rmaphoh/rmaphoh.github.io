abstract: 'IMPORTANCE: The potential association of schizophrenia with distinct retinal
  changes is of clinical interest but has been challenging to investigate because
  of a lack of sufficiently large and detailed cohorts. OBJECTIVE: To investigate
  the association between retinal biomarkers from multimodal imaging (oculomics) and
  schizophrenia in a large real-world population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
  This cross-sectional analysis used data from a retrospective cohort of 154 830 patients
  40 years and older from the AlzEye study, which linked ophthalmic data with hospital
  admission data across England. Patients attended Moorfields Eye Hospital, a secondary
  care ophthalmic hospital with a principal central site, 4 district hubs, and 5 satellite
  clinics in and around London, United Kingdom, and had retinal imaging during the
  study period (January 2008 and April 2018). Data were analyzed from January 2022
  to July 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Retinovascular and optic nerve indices
  were computed from color fundus photography. Macular retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)
  and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGC-IPL) thicknesses were extracted from
  optical coherence tomography. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the
  association between schizophrenia and retinal biomarkers. RESULTS: A total of 485
  individuals (747 eyes) with schizophrenia (mean [SD] age, 64.9 years [12.2]; 258
  [53.2%] female) and 100 931 individuals (165 400 eyes) without schizophrenia (mean
  age, 65.9 years [13.7]; 53 253 [52.8%] female) were included after images underwent
  quality control and potentially confounding conditions were excluded. Individuals
  with schizophrenia were more likely to have hypertension (407 [83.9%] vs 49 971
  [48.0%]) and diabetes (364 [75.1%] vs 28 762 [27.6%]). The schizophrenia group had
  thinner mGC-IPL (-4.05 μm, 95% CI, -5.40 to -2.69; P = 5.4 × 10-9), which persisted
  when investigating only patients without diabetes (-3.99 μm; 95% CI, -6.67 to -1.30;
  P = .004) or just those 55 years and younger (-2.90 μm; 95% CI, -5.55 to -0.24;
  P = .03). On adjusted analysis, retinal fractal dimension among vascular variables
  was reduced in individuals with schizophrenia (-0.14 units; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.05;
  P = .001), although this was not present when excluding patients with diabetes.
  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, patients with schizophrenia had measurable
  differences in neural and vascular integrity of the retina. Differences in retinal
  vasculature were mostly secondary to the higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension
  in patients with schizophrenia. The role of retinal features as adjunct outcomes
  in patients with schizophrenia warrants further investigation.'
