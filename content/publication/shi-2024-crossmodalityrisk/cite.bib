 abstract = {PURPOSE: We aim to use fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) to label the capillaries on color fundus (CF) photographs and train a deep learning model to quantify retinal capillaries noninvasively from CF and apply it to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 90732 pairs of CF-FFA images from 3893 participants for segmentation model development, and 49229 participants in the UK Biobank for association analysis. METHODS: We matched the vessels extracted from FFA and CF, and used vessels from FFA as labels to train a deep learning model (RMHAS-FA) to segment retinal capillaries using CF. We tested the model's accuracy on a manually labeled internal test set (FundusCapi). For external validation, we tested the segmentation model on 7 vessel segmentation datasets, and investigated the clinical value of the segmented vessels in predicting CVD events in the UK Biobank. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for segmentation. Hazard ratio (HR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) for Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: On the FundusCapi dataset, the segmentation performance was AUC = 0.95, accuracy = 0.94, sensitivity = 0.90, and specificity = 0.93. Smaller vessel skeleton density had a stronger correlation with CVD risk factors and incidence (P < 0.01). Reduced density of small vessel skeletons was strongly associated with an increased risk of CVD incidence and mortality for women (HR [95% CI] = 0.91 [0.84-0.98] and 0.68 [0.54-0.86], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Using paired CF-FFA images, we automated the laborious manual labeling process and enabled noninvasive capillary quantification from CF, supporting its potential as a sensitive screening method for identifying individuals at high risk of future CVD events.
