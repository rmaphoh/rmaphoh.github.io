abstract: Imaging biomarkers derived from medical images play an important role in
  diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response assessment. Developing prognostic imaging
  biomarkers which can achieve reliable survival prediction is essential for prognostication
  across various diseases and imaging modalities. In this work, we propose a method
  for discovering patch-level imaging patterns which we then use to predict mortality
  risk and identify prognostic biomarkers. Specifically, a contrastive learning model
  is first trained on patches to learn patch representations, followed by a clustering
  method to group similar underlying imaging patterns. The entire medical image can
  be thus represented by a long sequence of patch representations and their cluster
  assignments. Then a memory-efficient clustering Vision Transformer is proposed to
  aggregate all the patches to predict mortality risk of patients and identify high-risk
  patterns. To demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our model, we
  test the survival prediction performance of our method on two sets of patients with
  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic, progressive, and life-threatening
  interstitial pneumonia of unknown etiology. Moreover, by comparing the high-risk
  imaging patterns extracted by our model with existing imaging patterns utilised
  in clinical practice, we can identify a novel biomarker that may help clinicians
  improve risk stratification of IPF patients.
