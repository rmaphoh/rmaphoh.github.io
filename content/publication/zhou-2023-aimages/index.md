abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) offers great potential for recognizing
  signs of health conditions in retinal images and expediting the diagnosis of eye
  diseases and systemic disorders1. However, the development of AI models requires
  substantial annotation and models are usually task-specific with limited generalizability
  to different clinical applications2. Here, we present RETFound, a foundation model
  for retinal images that learns generalizable representations from unlabelled retinal
  images and provides a basis for label-efficient model adaptation in several applications.
  Specifically, RETFound is trained on 1.6â€‰million unlabelled retinal images by means
  of self-supervised learning and then adapted to disease detection tasks with explicit
  labels. We show that adapted RETFound consistently outperforms several comparison
  models in the diagnosis and prognosis of sight-threatening eye diseases, as well
  as incident prediction of complex systemic disorders such as heart failure and myocardial
  infarction with fewer labelled data. RETFound provides a generalizable solution
  to improve model performance and alleviate the annotation workload of experts to
  enable broad clinical AI applications from retinal imaging.
