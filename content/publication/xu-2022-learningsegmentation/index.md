abstract: We propose MisMatch, a novel consistency-driven semi-supervised segmentation
  framework which produces predictions that are invariant to learnt feature perturbations.
  MisMatch consists of an encoder and a two-head decoders. One decoder learns positive
  attention to the foreground regions of interest (RoI) on unlabelled images thereby
  generating dilated features. The other decoder learns negative attention to the
  foreground on the same unlabelled images thereby generating eroded features. We
  then apply a consistency regularisation on the paired predictions. MisMatch outperforms
  state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods on a CT-based pulmonary vessel segmentation
  task and a MRI-based brain tumour segmentation task. In addition, we show that the
  effectiveness of MisMatch comes from better model calibration than its supervised
  learning counterpart.
