abstract: 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Wearable devices allow for measurement of physical
  activity, potentially providing supplementary prognostic insights for predicting
  survival following radical cystectomy (RC), alongside commonly used conventional
  clinicopathological factors. The primary objective of this analysis is to assess
  the additional value of wearable device monitoring to pathological data in predicting
  survival.  METHODS: The iROC randomised trial (NCT03049410) compared peri-operative
  recovery after intracorporeal robot-assisted RC (iRARC) vs open RC (ORC) for bladder
  cancer. Step-count data was collected using wrist-worn wearable devices, and maximum
  steps and average steps per day was calculated at baseline and 12 weeks post-RC.
  Stamina was measured using the 30 second chair-to-stand test at similar timepoints.
  Clinicopathological data and survival data was collected, and cross-sectional imaging
  was used to determine cancer recurrence.  RESULTS: Among 338 patients in the iROC
  trial, 319 patients received RC. Overall survival following RC was 87% (319-41/319)
  patients and RFS was 82% (319-57/319) over a median follow-up of 33 months. Wearable
  device data was available for 165 patients for analysis. There was no significant
  reduction in maximum step-counts at baseline (mean 9388 , SD 4552) when compared
  with 3-months post-operatively (mean 8792, SD 4055). Using clinicopathological features
  including age, gender, BMI, pathological T-stage and surgical margin, we demonstrated
  an AUC of 74% to predict RFS which improved slightly to 76% on adding activity and
  stamina data. For prediction of OS, using clinicopathological features demonstrated
  an AUC of 71%, which improved to 81% with the addition of activity and stamina data.
  Kaplan Meier analysis with patients divided into low and high risk groups by the
  final model showed an increased PFS (99% vs 59%) and OS (98% vs 53%) in 33 months
  after surgery.  CONCLUSIONS: Mobility data may offer information which could add
  value to traditional prognostic models for survival. With new wearable devices,
  activity data can be remotely collected alongside other biometric data such as heart
  rate which may further improve models to predict RFS and OS.  Source of Funding:
